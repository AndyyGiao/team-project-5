        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>For me, I'm crafting these exercises new this year, though I have taught JavaScript for many years.
            Trying to create exercises and code that build on previous things we've learned <i>and</i> experiment with
            new things</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I created a pretty straight forward conditional in my function, but realized after writing it, the repetitive
            structure probably means there is a more efficient way to write this.
            Probably using an object as key-value pairs will be simple, work really well, and be easy to maintain.</p>
